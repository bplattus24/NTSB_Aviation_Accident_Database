## Project Objectives
1. Identify **aircraft manufacturers** and **models** with the best safety records.
2. Analyze trends in aviation incidents, injuries, and safety metrics.
3. Provide actionable recommendations for investments in aircraft that balance **safety** and **cost-effectiveness**.

## Data Overview

The dataset includes information about aviation incidents and accidents from **2013 to 2023**. Key features analyzed:
- **Quantitative data**: Counts of incidents, injuries, and safety ratings.
- **Qualitative data**: Manufacturer and model details, safety trends over time.

## Key Findings

### 1. Trend in Injuries (Year-over-Year)
- **Significant decrease** in overall injuries from 1982 to 2023.
- Injuries have shown a consistent **decline over the last 10 years**, reflecting improvements in aviation safety standards.

### 2. Injuries by Most Recurring Manufacturers
- **Airbus**:
  - 9% chance of injury during an incident.
  - **91% safety rating** (second highest).
- **Boeing**:
  - 26% chance of injury during an incident.
  - Highest number of uninjured passengers (25,000+).
  - **92% safety rating** (highest).

### 3. Incidents by Most Recurring Manufacturers
- **Airbus**:
  - Second-lowest incident count per year.
  - 4% likelihood of an incident.
- **Boeing**:
  - Lowest incident count per year.
  - **1.4% likelihood** of an incident.

### 4. Incidents by Most Recurring Models
- **Boeing 757**:
  - Lowest total incidents in the past 10 years.
  - **4% likelihood** of an incident.
- **Airbus 231**:
  - Safety rating of 100%.
  - **6% likelihood** of an incident.

### 5. Size Matters: Larger Aircraft Are Safer
Both **Boeing 757** and **Airbus 231** demonstrate that larger aircraft have superior safety records.

## Visualizations
Key visuals include:
- Year-over-year trends in injuries.
- Manufacturer and model-specific safety ratings.
- Incidents and injuries per manufacturer and model.

---

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis:
1. **Prioritize Boeing and Airbus for investment**:
   - Boeing: Best safety record and lowest likelihood of incidents.
   - Airbus: Strong safety ratings with consistently low incident counts.
2. **Focus on larger aircraft models** like the Boeing 757 and Airbus 231.
3. Further evaluate **pricing** for recommended models to balance safety and cost.

---

## Next Steps
1. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis of recommended aircraft models.
2. Investigate additional factors like fuel efficiency and maintenance costs.
3. Explore external data sources to validate findings and provide a comprehensive investment proposal.
